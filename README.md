## GATE CSE Marking Scheme 2022
- The paper is of 100 marks and the total number of questions is 65
- The language of the paper is English.
- MCQs - 1 Marks – For each right answer; 1/3 marks will be deducted for each wrong answer. 
- MCQs - 2 Marks – For each right answer; 2/3 marks will be deducted for each of the wrong answers.
- NAT – There is no negative checking for Numerical Answer Type (NAT) questions. 
- MSQ – There is no negative marking for a wrong answer in MSQ questions. However, there are no partial marks awarded for choosing partially correct combinations of choices or any single wrong choice
